## How I Think About Applied AI

My engineering philosophy centers on:

- **Real data realism** — data in the wild is noisy, incomplete, and expensive to label.  
- **Operational constraints** — latency, cost, and false positives matter far more than raw accuracy.  
- **Decision systems over models** — AI should improve decisions, not just make predictions.  
- **Robustness and interpretability** — systems must survive failure modes and provide insight.  

These principles guide both prototype code and professional work.
