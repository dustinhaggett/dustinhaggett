# Dustin Haggett

**Applied AI & Systems Engineer**  
I build AI systems and engineering tools that work under real data constraints — noisy signals, operational tradeoffs, and production realities.

I’m focused on practical machine learning, agentic systems, multimodal perception, and data-driven decision architectures. Most of my production systems are proprietary or client-facing, so this GitHub surfaces how I think, prototype, and structure real applied work.

## Featured Projects

These are the highest-level projects from my portfolio — representing systems, tools, and AI design patterns I’ve worked on or prototyped.

### AI & Signal Systems
*(Descriptions drawn from my personal portfolio)*

- **SpinOut Radar** — A detection and pattern-recognition system with signal application context. [oai_citation:3‡dustinhaggett.com](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/spinout-radar?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **LabelFlow** — Tooling for labeled data workflows and structured inference. [oai_citation:4‡dustinhaggett.com](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/labelflow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **DeepFile** — A project focused on deep learning applied to structured and unstructured inputs. [oai_citation:5‡dustinhaggett.com](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/deepfile?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Chart Vision** — Experiments in perceptual pattern extraction from structured visual/text data. [oai_citation:6‡dustinhaggett.com](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/chart-vision?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Public Work on GitHub

Here are some of the public repositories I’ve developed or curated:

- **RegimeSignal** – Python project exploring regime classification signals. [oai_citation:8‡GitHub](https://github.com/dustinhaggett?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **reading-notes** – Curated notes on cyber operations and security. [oai_citation:9‡GitHub](https://github.com/dustinhaggett?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **ops-201d8-code-challenges**, **ops-301d8-code-challenges**, **ops-401d8-code-challenges** – Practice and structured coding exercises in shell and Python. [oai_citation:10‡GitHub](https://github.com/dustinhaggett?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **remix** – An exploratory codebase (in progress). [oai_citation:11‡GitHub](https://github.com/dustinhaggett?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

These repos range from systems tooling to learning notes — and reflect how I build and document code over time.

## How I Think About Applied AI

My engineering philosophy centers on:

- **Real data realism** — data in the wild is noisy, incomplete, and expensive to label.  
- **Operational constraints** — latency, cost, and false positives matter far more than raw accuracy.  
- **Decision systems over models** — AI should improve decisions, not just make predictions.  
- **Robustness and interpretability** — systems must survive failure modes and provide insight.  

These principles guide both prototype code and professional work.
