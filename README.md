## Selected Work

### AI & Signal Systems

- **[RegimeAlpha](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/regimealpha)** — LSTM + attention time-series system for identifying BTC market regimes, with drift detection and a walk-forward evaluation engine.

- **[SpinOut Radar](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/spinout-radar)** — RAG-powered deep-tech scouting system using embeddings, Supabase, and AI summaries to surface emerging spinouts and trends.

- **[DeepFile](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/deepfile)** — Intelligence document extraction and retrieval system combining OCR, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented QA.

- **[Landflip](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/landflip)** — Geospatial pipeline for Brazilian coastal land intelligence built on OpenStreetMap data and Python.

- **[ShopperOS](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/shopperos)** — Cross-web personal shopping AI using taste graphs and fit-profile embeddings to improve purchase decisions.

- **[LabelFlow](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/labelflow)** — GenAI-native labeling platform with RAG evaluation, hallucination testing, and instant payouts.

### Research

- **[Chart Vision](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/chart-vision)** — Deep learning study on candlestick chart prediction comparing CNN architectures; a simple 4-layer CNN achieved 0.892 AUC-ROC, outperforming ResNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers.

- **[BioLink](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/biolink)** — Drug–disease modeling research using BioBERT / PubMedBERT embeddings and knowledge-graph propagation.

- **[Federated IDs](https://dustinhaggett.com/projects/federated-ids)** — Research on federated learning for intrusion detection, evaluating privacy-preserving distributed training across network security datasets.
